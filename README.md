####Just a git collection of a bunch of random scripts and programs I've written over the years!
<hr>
Code I have written for personal/class projects and fun, right now all the FA web-scrapers are the most recent code. I would also look at
my college final project where we building a <a href="https://github.com/UWYO-Fall15-Sr-Design-Drone/CoscSrDesignDrones">automated ground mapping drone.</a> I'm doing all the web frontend on that and all the server side bash scripting for that (Found in ImageEdit).

Everything else in here is old and outdated but is handly to have, feel free to contact me at efirds@hotmail.com
for any questions. 

Thanks,

Scotty
