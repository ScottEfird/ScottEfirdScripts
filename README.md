####Just a git collection of a bunch of random scripts and programs I've written over the years!
<hr>
Code I have written for personal/class projects and fun, right now all the FA web-scrapers are the most recent code. I would also look at
my college final project where we building a <a href="https://github.com/UWYO-Fall15-Sr-Design-Drone/CoscSrDesignDrones">automated ground mapping drone.</a> I'm doing all the web frontend on that and all the server side bash scripting for that (Found in ImageEdit).

Part of a year long class at UWyo, we worked with the software development company Underwriters Laboratories in laramie to build the foundation for a muti year project. We created Agilestudent, a website that allows non technical users to apply the agile scrum methodology to their own projects. You can view the project here, I'd also recommend taking a few seconds to create an account to view the nuts and bolts of the project. (Note, website and database a hair slow, we are using the free azure hosting)

There are some personal projects here and some old code I'm keeping around, feel free to contact me at efirds@hotmail.com
for any questions. 

Thanks,

Scotty
