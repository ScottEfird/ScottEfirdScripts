Just a git collection of a bunch of random scripts and programs I've written over the years!

I have written for projects and fun, right now all the FA web scrapers are the most recent code, I'd also look at 
my college final project:
https://github.com/UWYO-Fall15-Sr-Design-Drone/CoscSrDesignDrones

I'm doing all the web front end on that and all the server side bash scripting for that (Found in ImageEdit)

Everything else in here is old and outdated but is handly to have, feel free to contact me at efirds@hotmail.com
for any questions. 

Thanks,

Scotty
